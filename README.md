# WowCater Account Manager Email Signature

url:https://onthegocode.github.io/Wowcater-emailsignature/

This is a email signature made for a client on Upwork for the Account Manager at WowCater. The signature is optimized to work with Gmail. If you open the link you may notice that there is some weird looking padding thats due to adjustment needed to be made for it to look good on gmail. If you upload this signature on Gmail you will see it looks just fine. I asssume this is due to formatting issues in Gmail, there fore adjustments need to be made(extra padding). I used display: inline-block since float doesn't work with gmail.
